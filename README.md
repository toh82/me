# Hey ya, I'm Tobias Hartmann

... a main time developer, hobby designer and photographer.

After 10 years of web design and frontend coding, I started heavily working with JavaScript, CSS preprocessors and Magento about 4 years ago. Starting as a junior frontend developer at a big company, I made my way through smaller design agencies as a technical project lead, frontend concept engineer, designer and developer. As a trained designer and mainly self-learned frontend developer, I really enjoy the powers of both worlds and love to combine them, to make awesome projects. Nowadays I work as a lead frontend developer for e-commerce projects at [**Sitewards**](http://www.sitewards.com/).

I love contributing to open source projects and community work in general, because of the huge amount of power which a community can share. My strengths are solving structural issues with HTML and stylesheets, writing styles, designing/developing user interfaces for apps and shops.

Last year, I started with public speaking, which is a lot of fun. Meanwhile, I talked on conferences like the **MeetMagento Switzerland** and the **MeetMagento Netherland**, also on several user groups like the [**MobileDevFFM**](https://twitter.com/MobileDevFfm) or unconferences like the [**Mage Unconference**](http://www.mageunconference.org/). My talks are about **Magento**, **Wireframes**, **talking on stage** and **developer feelings**. If you're interested, you find links to the Slides just a little scroll down.  

### What else
